	<h1>SiAgent Automated Negotiator</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the <em>SiAgent</em> Automated Negotiator.</p>
	<p><em>SiAgent</em> wants to sell you a package consisting of some
	electronic components. You are able to negotiate the price with it.
	To begin a new negotiation, enter your name below, select the automated
	agent you wish to negotiate with (<em>SiAgent</em> or <em>TFTAgent
	</em>) and click the <em>New Session</em> button.</p>
	<p><em>SiAgent</em> will propose an offer, and you can provide an answer
	by pressing one of the buttons in the interface. You can propose counter
	offers until round 5. If no agreement is made, the initial offer will be
	agreed upon. Also, you can leave the negotiation at any time by pressing
	the <em>Opt out</em> button. All the <em>End round</em> button does is
	delay the negotiation for a round. A price of 0 denotes that you do
	not wish to buy that object.
	</p>
	<p>The negotiation will be logged for research purposes. To provide a
	comparison, it is recommended that you negotiate with the two agents
	(<em>SiAgent</em> and <em>TFTAgent</em>).
	</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The agent is still in an experimental stage. 
	Bug reports and suggestions should go at
