Negotiator Agent
================

A. About
........

The Negotiator Agent is, as the name suggests, an automated agent
capable of bilateral negotiations (only that, at the moment) with humans
and possibly with other automated agents.

The project was created as an application for the Bachelor's Thesis by
Lucian Mogo»ôanu, and is primarily based upon Sarit Kraus's paper
"*An Automated Agent for Bilateral Negotiation with Bounded Rational 
Agents with Incomplete Information*" `[1]`_.

B. Project Dependencies
.......................

The following represent Haskell dependencies for every top-level
module of the application:

* *Negotiator*: Control.Monad.State, available via the Ubuntu/Debian
  package libghc6-mtl-dev.
